# ModelingNavySystems Tests

Sample configs for Ethernet simulation:

- `ethernet_office.yaml` (office LAN with VLANs and firewall)
- `ethernet_datacenter.json` (mini data center topology)
- `ethernet_branch.yaml` (branch office with VLANs and file server)
- `ethernet_campus.yaml` (campus-style redundant core)
- `ethernet_home.yaml` (simple home LAN with PCs and IoT)
